# Diversity Charter

We believe that all members of the technical community are equally important.

We are part a tech community where we value a diverse network, and learn and share from one another: 

* regardless of age, 
* regardless of colour, 
* regardless of their ethnicity, 
* regardless of their religion or beliefs, 
* regardless of disability, 
* regardless of gender, 
* regardless of sexual orientation, 
* regardless of their race, 
* regardless of their ability or lack of ability, 
* regardless of nationality or accent. 

We are a diverse tech community where we are all individuals with differences, but we are all members and we can all learn from each other.
